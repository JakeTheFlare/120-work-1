git notes.
order of operations- save file in Atom, git status. when something has been changed, do git add * to update in branch tree. Then do git commit -m "message explaining changes" to commit changes to repository. to view git commit history, use git log.
to start a new project, git init project name to create new directory
git designed for team collaboration, people working in sequential fashion and at the same time.
