# KATY SPENCE 50
## HOMEWORK FOR SEPT. 21, 2017

1. During this past week, I learned how to do basic tasks in my command-line interface, PowerShell. I spent a lot of time in PowerShell just creating, moving and editing content to familiarize myself with looking at (and thinking about) directories in a new way. I set up the various programs--GitHub Desktop, Atom, SourceTree-- and spent some time practicing with them. I feel good about everything so far, but I find myself wishing I had someone to physically talk to about what I'm learning. None of my friends are really familiar with what we're doing in this class, and sometimes it's helpful just to talk about a process out loud.

2. For this particular assignment, I...
  1. Created the necessary directory and .md file.
  2. Started with planning where the formatting specifications would go, making adjustments along the way as needed.
  3. Started by answering the last questions first, though I don't know why.
  4. Took a screenshot.

3. I actually had a number of small struggles, and I considered submitting an issue several times. I'll list these a couple of thse struggles here.
  -I'm still having an issue with some things in Powershell. For example, I can open Notepad by simply typing Notepad, but I can't do the same with Atom, and I don't know why.
  -I'm having [the same issue opening Atom from Github desktop](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding_Fall2017/issues/23), but I've haven't had luck with any of the suggested solutions. I'll keep searching. I actually used a bunch of different sites in trying to familiarize myself with all the different applications. [This GitHib PowerShell guide](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/learning-powershell/powershell-beginners-guide.md) was something I used quite a bit, and I visited a number of random forums looking for feedback about some of my errors. There was some helpful feedback in our own Issues forum, especially on the issue about screenshot specifications.

4. I would be interested in learning more about the command prompt (powershell, in my case). When I was doing research about some of my issues, I saw that there are way more applications of the powershell tool that I could have imagined. I'd love to learn more about it.

5. I don't know if I helped, but I contributed a comment to [this issue about Atom running slow](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/120_CreativeCoding_Fall2017/issues/19) because I've been experiencing the same thing, though to a much lesser degree.
